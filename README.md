- 0-1: `3 + 4;` evaluates to 7 and has no side effects
- 0-5: It is not a valid program as `main()` is not enclosed in braces
- 0-6: It is a valid program as `main()` is enclosed in matching braces
- 0-7: It is a valid program as the comment delimiters are correct

# to-do

- Read chapter 1

# takeaway

- `cout << "hello world" << endl` writes `hello world` to the standard output stream as a [side effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science))
- `<<` is [left-associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_associativity)
- Reading from the standard input stream [flushes](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ostream/flush-free/) the output buffer
